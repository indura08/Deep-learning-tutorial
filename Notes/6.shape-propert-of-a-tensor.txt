🔹 What does shape mean?
=========================

The shape tells you how many elements (numbers) are along each dimension (axis).

Each number inside the parentheses represents the size of that dimension.

✅ Example 1: shape = (3,)

👉 This means 1D tensor with 3 elements.

[1, 2, 3]


Only one axis (a line).

Size = 3 numbers.

✅ Example 2: shape = (3, 3)

👉 This means 2D tensor → 3 rows × 3 columns.

[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]]


First 3 = number of rows.

Second 3 = number of columns.

✅ Example 3: shape = (3, 3, 3)

👉 This means 3D tensor → 3 blocks × 3 rows × 3 columns.

Think of it as 3 matrices stacked on top of each other:

[
 [[1,2,3], 
  [4,5,6], 
  [7,8,9]],

 [[10,11,12],
  [13,14,15],
  [16,17,18]],

 [[19,20,21],
  [22,23,24],
  [25,26,27]]
]


First 3 = number of blocks (depth).

Second 3 = rows.

Third 3 = columns.

✅ Example 4: shape = (2, 3, 1)

👉 This means 3D tensor → 2 blocks × 3 rows × 1 column.

[
 [[1], 
  [2], 
  [3]],

 [[4], 
  [5], 
  [6]]
]


First 2 = 2 blocks.

Second 3 = each block has 3 rows.

Third 1 = each row has 1 column.


🔹 General Rule:

Each number inside shape = size of that axis.

The number of numbers inside shape = how many dimensions (axes).

Examples:

(3,) → 1D with 3 items.

(3, 3) → 2D with 3×3 = 9 items.

(3, 3, 3) → 3D with 3×3×3 = 27 items.

(2, 3, 1) → 3D with 2×3×1 = 6 items.

👉 In short: shape tells you the layout of your data — how many blocks, rows, and columns (and more dimensions if needed).

🔹 Can there be shapes like (3,2,2,1)?

✅ Absolutely. That just means a 4D tensor → 4 axes.
Each number tells you how big that axis is.


✅ 4D (shape = (3, 2, 2, 1))

3 blocks × 2 groups × 2 rows × 1 column:

[
 [ [[1], [2]], 
   [[3], [4]] ],

 [ [[5], [6]], 
   [[7], [8]] ],

 [ [[9], [10]], 
   [[11], [12]] ]
]


✅ 5D (shape = (3, 2, 1, 4, 5))

Now it gets harder to “draw” 🤯, but here’s what it means:

3 → outermost “big blocks”

2 → inside each block, 2 groups

1 → each group has 1 row

4 → each row has 4 items

5 → each item has 5 numbers

So basically:

3 × 2 × 1 × 4 × 5 = 120 numbers total.

Tiny slice example of the structure:

[
  [  # first big block
    [  # first group
      [ 
        [[1,2,3,4,5],
         [6,7,8,9,10],
         [11,12,13,14,15],
         [16,17,18,19,20]]
      ]
    ],

    [  # second group
      [ 
        [[21,22,23,24,25],
         [26,27,28,29,30],
         [31,32,33,34,35],
         [36,37,38,39,40]]
      ]
    ]
  ],

  ... more blocks
]


✅ 6D (shape = (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2))

That means 64 numbers total (2×2×2×2×2×2).
Think of it like a cube of cubes of cubes 🤯.
Hard to draw, but you can imagine each axis keeps nesting deeper.


✅ 100D tensor

Yes, possible! Shape might look like:

(2, 2, 2, ... , 2)   # with 100 twos


That means 2^100 numbers total (which is beyond huge).

👉 In practice, we don’t go that high because it’s too big for memory. But mathematically, TensorFlow supports it.
