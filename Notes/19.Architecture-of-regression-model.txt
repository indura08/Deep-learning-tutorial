1. The Simplest Regression Model (Linear Regression)
-------------------------------------------------------

Architecture:

Input → One computation → Output

Example formula:

y = wX + b

What happens:

	Take input

	Multiply by weight

	Add bias

	Output a number

That’s the simplest regression architecture.

2.Neural Network Regression Architecture

Now instead of one computation, we stack layers.

Basic structure:

Input Layer
Hidden Layer(s)
Output Layer

Flow looks like this:

Input → Hidden → Hidden → Output

3. Let’s explain each part clearly

A) Input Layer

This is where your features enter.

Example:

If predicting house price:

Inputs:
Size
Bedrooms
Age

Then input layer has 3 values.

It does not "do" anything.
It just receives data.

B) Hidden Layer

This is where learning happens.

Each hidden layer:

	Multiplies inputs by weights

	Adds bias

	Applies activation function

Activation function is just a math function that helps the network learn complex patterns.

Common one in regression:
ReLU

ReLU(x) = max(0, x)

So negative values become 0.

C) Output Layer

In regression:

The output layer usually has 1 neuron.

Why?

Because we want 1 number.

Important:
For regression, we usually DO NOT use softmax.
We usually use:

Linear activation (no activation)
or
Just raw output

Because we want any real number.

4. Example Architecture

Suppose:

We have 3 inputs.
We use 1 hidden layer with 4 neurons.
We want 1 output.

Architecture:

Input (3 values)
→ Dense layer (4 neurons, ReLU)
→ Dense layer (1 neuron, linear)

In TensorFlow:

model = Sequential([
Dense(4, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,)),
Dense(1)
])

That’s a regression model.

5. What happens inside?

Step by step:

Inputs enter (3 numbers)

Hidden layer multiplies each input by weights

Adds bias

Applies activation

Produces 4 new numbers

Output layer combines those 4 numbers

Produces 1 final number

That final number is your prediction.


6. Loss Function (Important for regression)

Regression usually uses:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Why?

Because we care about how far the predicted number is from the real number.

Model tries to reduce that difference.

7. Training Process

Architecture stays fixed.

During training:

Model makes prediction

Calculate error

Adjust weights slightly

Repeat many times

Eventually:
Predictions become close to real values.

8. Simple Visual Structure

Example:

Input: 3 values

Layer 1:
3 → 4 neurons

Layer 2:
4 → 1 neuron

Final output:
1 number

That’s regression architecture.

9. Important Differences from Classification Architecture

Regression:
Output layer = 1 neuron
Activation = usually linear
Loss = MSE

Classification:
Output layer = number of classes
Activation = softmax or sigmoid
Loss = cross entropy

10. Final Simple Summary

Regression model architecture =

Input layer
+
One or more hidden layers
+
One output neuron that produces a number

Everything inside is just:
Multiply
Add
Apply activation
Repeat

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in tutorial there were some hyperparameters mentioned in related to regression model architecture, now lets see each one of them in a well explained manner






1. Input layer shape

This defines how many features your model receives.

If your data has:

3 features (for example: size, bedrooms, age)
then the input shape is (3,)

If your dataset has 10 features, the input shape is (10,)

Important:

Input shape = number of features per sample
It does NOT include the number of samples.

Example:

If you have 100 houses and each house has 3 features:

Data shape = (100, 3)
Input layer shape = (3,)



2. Hidden layers

Hidden layers are the layers between input and output.

They allow the model to learn complex patterns.

If you have:

Input → Hidden → Output
That is 1 hidden layer.

If you have:

Input → Hidden → Hidden → Output
That is 2 hidden layers.

More hidden layers = deeper model.

In regression, sometimes even 1 or 2 hidden layers is enough.



3. Neurons per hidden layer

Neurons are the units inside a layer.

If you write:

Dense(8)

That means the layer has 8 neurons.

Each neuron:

multiplies inputs by weights

adds bias

applies activation

More neurons = more learning capacity
Too many neurons = risk of overfitting

Example:

Dense(4) → small layer
Dense(128) → much larger layer



4. Output layer shape

In regression, we usually predict one number.

So the output layer usually has:

Dense(1)

That means output shape is (1,)

If you want to predict 3 numbers (for example: price, tax, insurance), then:

Dense(3)

Output shape must match how many values you want to predict.



5. Hidden activation

Activation function adds non-linearity.

Without activation, the network behaves like simple linear regression.

Common hidden activations in regression:

ReLU
tanh

ReLU is most common.

ReLU(x) = max(0, x)

This allows the network to learn more complex patterns.

If you remove activation, the model becomes limited.



6. Output activation

In regression, the output is usually a real number.

So most of the time we use:

Linear activation (which means no activation function).

In TensorFlow:

Dense(1)
This automatically uses linear activation.

We do not use softmax in regression.

We do not use sigmoid unless we want output restricted between 0 and 1.



7. Loss function

Loss function measures how wrong the prediction is.

In regression, common loss functions are:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error:

(predicted − actual)²
Then average over all samples.

Mean Absolute Error:

|predicted − actual|
Then average.

The model tries to minimize this loss.

Lower loss = better predictions.



8. Optimizer

The optimizer updates the weights to reduce the loss.

It decides how the model learns.

Common optimizers:

SGD
Adam
RMSprop

Adam is very commonly used because it works well in most cases.

The optimizer controls:

how fast weights change

how learning progresses

If learning rate is too high → model may become unstable
If too low → learning becomes very slow

Complete simple picture of regression architecture

You define:

Input shape
Number of hidden layers
Neurons per layer
Hidden activation
Output layer size
Output activation
Loss function
Optimizer

Then training begins.

Model makes prediction → calculate loss → optimizer adjusts weights → repeat.

Very simple summary

Input shape = how many features
Hidden layers = how many processing layers
Neurons = size of each hidden layer
Output shape = how many numbers to predict
Hidden activation = how hidden layers transform data
Output activation = how final prediction behaves
Loss function = how error is measured
Optimizer = how weights are updated
