What is Matplotlib?
----------------------

Matplotlib is a Python library used for plotting graphs and visualizing data.

Think of it as:

A tool that converts numbers into visual graphs.

Instead of just seeing rows of numbers, you can see:

trends

patterns

relationships

distributions

That makes understanding data much easier.

What is it used for?

Matplotlib is commonly used for:

Line graphs (show trends over time)

Bar charts (compare categories)

Scatter plots (see relationships between variables)

Histograms (see distributions)

Pie charts (show proportions)

In machine learning, it is used to:

Visualize datasets

Plot training loss

Compare predictions vs actual values

Display model performance



Example 1: Line Plot (Trend Over Time)
======================================

Imagine we track loss during training.


Code:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [10, 8, 6, 5, 3]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel("Epoch")
plt.ylabel("Loss")
plt.title("Training Loss")
plt.show()

This creates a line graph showing how loss decreases.


Example 2: Scatter Plot (Relationship Between Variables)
=========================================================

Example: house size vs price.

Code:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

size = [500, 800, 1000, 1200, 1500]
price = [100, 150, 200, 250, 300]

plt.scatter(size, price)
plt.xlabel("House Size")
plt.ylabel("Price")
plt.title("Size vs Price")
plt.show()

This helps you see if price increases with size


Example 3: Bar Chart (Compare Categories)
============================================


Code:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

subjects = ["Math", "Physics", "Chemistry"]
marks = [85, 90, 78]

plt.bar(subjects, marks)
plt.xlabel("Subjects")
plt.ylabel("Marks")
plt.title("Student Scores")
plt.show()

Used when comparing categories.


Example 4: Histogram (Distribution of Data)
=============================================

Code:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

marks = [60, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 70, 85]

plt.hist(marks, bins=5)
plt.xlabel("Marks")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Distribution of Marks")
plt.show()

This shows how values are distributed.



Why Matplotlib is Important in Machine Learning

You will use it to:

Plot loss vs epochs

Visualize regression line

Compare predicted vs actual values

Analyze dataset before training

Without visualization, you are training blindly.

Simple Summary

Matplotlib is a Python library used to create graphs.

It helps you:

Understand data

See patterns

Debug models

Present results clearly

If you're serious about machine learning, this is not optional — it’s essential.
