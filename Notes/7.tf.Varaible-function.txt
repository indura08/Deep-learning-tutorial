🔹 What is tf.Variable()?
==========================

In TensorFlow, tf.Variable() is like a box that holds values, but the key thing is:
👉 The values inside this box can change when your program runs.

Think of it like a notebook:

You can write something in it.

Later, you can erase it and write something new.

That’s what tf.Variable() does — it stores data that can be updated (like weights in a neural network that keep changing while training).

Example:

import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(5)   # A variable that starts with value 5
print(x)             # -> <tf.Variable 'Variable:0' shape=() dtype=int32, numpy=5>

x.assign(10)         # Change the value inside it
print(x)             # -> now it's 10


🔹 What is tf.constant()?
=============================

This is also a box that holds values, but the value inside it cannot change.
👉 It’s like writing something with a permanent marker.

Once you set it, it’s fixed.

Example:

y = tf.constant(5)   # A constant with value 5
print(y)

# y.assign(10) ❌ This will give an error because you can’t change it


🔑 Difference between tf.Variable and tf.Constant
===================================================

| Feature           | `tf.Variable()`                                                | `tf.constant()`                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Can change value? | ✅ Yes, you can update                                          | ❌ No, fixed forever                                                |
| Use case          | Things that **learn/change** during training (weights, biases) | Things that stay the same (like pi = 3.14, or fixed lookup values) |
| Analogy           | Notebook (erasable)                                            | Permanent marker                                                   |


Simple Analogy

tf.Variable() → Your bank account balance 💰 (it keeps changing as you deposit/withdraw).

tf.constant() → Your date of birth 🎂 (fixed forever).
