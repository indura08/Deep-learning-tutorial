First: Neural Network Regression.

Regression means predicting a number.

That’s it.

If the output of a model is a continuous number like:

House price → 250000

Temperature → 32.5

Weight → 68.2

Salary → 54000

That is regression.

Now what is neural network regression?

It just means:

Using a neural network to predict a number.

So instead of using a simple formula like linear regression:

y = mx + b

We use a neural network to learn that relationship.

Very Simple Example

Imagine this data:

Hours studied → Exam score

1 → 50
2 → 60
3 → 70
4 → 80

The pattern is roughly:

Score = 10 × Hours + 40

A neural network tries to learn that relationship automatically.

It takes:

Input → 3 hours
It predicts → 72

The real answer might be → 70

It adjusts itself to get closer next time.

That’s neural network regression.

Input → number(s)
Output → one number

What does the network actually do?

Inside, it:

Multiplies inputs by weights

Adds bias

Passes through layers

Produces a final number

That final number is the prediction.

There is no category. No classes. Just a number.

That’s regression.

Now second part:

Difference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

Machine Learning is the bigger field.

Deep Learning is a part of machine learning.

Machine Learning includes:

Linear regression

Logistic regression

Decision trees

Random forest

Support vector machines

Neural networks

Deep Learning specifically means:

Using neural networks with many layers.

That’s why it’s called “deep” — many layers stacked.

Simple comparison

Machine Learning:

Can use simple models

Often needs manual feature selection

Works well on structured data (tables)

Deep Learning:

Uses neural networks

Automatically learns features

Works very well on images, audio, text

Example

If you want to predict house prices using:

Bedrooms, bathrooms, area

You can use normal machine learning like linear regression.

If you want to recognize cats in images:

You usually use deep learning (convolutional neural networks).

Very clear summary

Regression:
Predicting a number.

Neural network regression:
Using a neural network to predict a number.

Machine learning:
The general field of models that learn from data.

Deep learning:
A special part of machine learning that uses multi-layer neural networks.
