🔹 Basic Tensor Operations
----------------------------

1. Addition / Subtraction
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
b = tf.constant([4, 5, 6])

print(a + b)   # [5, 7, 9]
print(a - b)   # [-3, -3, -3]

👉 Just like normal numbers, but applied element by element.

2. Multiplication / Division
-----------------------------

print(a * b)   # [4, 10, 18]   (element-wise multiplication)
print(b / a)   # [4.0, 2.5, 2.0]  (element-wise division)

3. Exponent / Power
--------------------

print(a ** 2)       # [1, 4, 9]
print(tf.square(b)) # [16, 25, 36]

4. Matrix Operations (dot product / matrix multiply)
------------------------------------------------------

When tensors are 2D (like tables), multiplication can mean linear algebra multiplication, not just element-by-element.

m1 = tf.constant([[1, 2],
                  [3, 4]])
m2 = tf.constant([[5, 6],
                  [7, 8]])

print(tf.matmul(m1, m2))
# [[19, 22],
#  [43, 50]]


👉 This is matrix multiplication, important for neural networks.


5. Broadcasting
-----------------

TensorFlow is smart: if shapes are different but “compatible,” it stretches the smaller tensor.

x = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
y = tf.constant(2)   # just a single number

print(x + y)  # [3, 4, 5]


👉 It “broadcasted” the 2 across [1,2,3].


6. Aggregation Operations
--------------------------

These shrink tensors into single values.

c = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3],
                 [4, 5, 6]])

print(tf.reduce_sum(c))     # 21 (adds all elements)
print(tf.reduce_mean(c))    # 3.5 (average)
print(tf.reduce_max(c))     # 6 (biggest number)
print(tf.reduce_min(c))     # 1 (smallest number)


7. Reshaping Tensors
---------------------

Change shape without changing data.

d = tf.range(1, 7)     # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
reshaped = tf.reshape(d, (2, 3))
print(reshaped)
# [[1, 2, 3],
#  [4, 5, 6]]


✅ Summary

You can do math on tensors like numbers (+ - * /).

You can do matrix multiplication with tf.matmul.

TensorFlow auto-adjusts with broadcasting.

You can summarize tensors with aggregation (sum, mean, max, min).

You can reshape tensors into new dimensions.

👉 So, manipulating tensors = playing with numbers in bulk.
It’s like moving from a calculator (one number at a time) to Excel (whole tables at once).
