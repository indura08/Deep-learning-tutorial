ðŸ”¹ What is a Random Tensor?
==============================

A tensor (like we discussed) is just a container for numbers, shaped in some way (1D, 2D, 3D, etc.).

A random tensor means:

Instead of filling it with fixed numbers (like [1,2,3]),

TensorFlow fills it with randomly chosen numbers.

These numbers are not predictable but follow certain rules (like rolling dice, flipping coins, or picking numbers from a box).

ðŸ”¹ Why Generate Random Tensors?
==================================

In machine learning, randomness is super important:

1. Weights initialization â€“ When training neural networks, the starting values of weights are random.

2. Data shuffling â€“ Keeps training unbiased.

3. Simulation â€“ You can test models with random input data.

ðŸ”¹ Ways to Generate Random Tensors in TensorFlow
==================================================

1. Uniform distribution â€“ numbers are picked with equal chance from a range.

import tensorflow as tf

# Random numbers between 0 and 1
x = tf.random.uniform(shape=(3,3), minval=0, maxval=10)  
print(x)


ðŸ‘‰ Each number is equally likely to be between 0 and 10.


2. Normal (Gaussian) distribution â€“ numbers are chosen around a mean (average), like a bell curve.

y = tf.random.normal(shape=(3,3), mean=0, stddev=1)  
print(y)


ðŸ‘‰ Most numbers will be close to 0, some a bit far away.


3. Random integers â€“ whole numbers only.

z = tf.random.uniform(shape=(3,3), minval=1, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)
print(z)


ðŸ‘‰ Gives you random integers from 1 to 9.


ðŸ”¹ Key Things to Understand
=============================

shape â†’ tells the "box size" of numbers you want (e.g., (3,3) is a 3Ã—3 grid).

distribution type â†’ tells how the numbers are picked (uniform, normal, etc.).

range â†’ minimum and maximum values.

ðŸ”¹ Example with Different Shapes
===================================

# 1D random tensor (like a line of numbers)
a = tf.random.uniform(shape=(5,))  

# 2D random tensor (like a table)
b = tf.random.uniform(shape=(3,3))  

# 3D random tensor (like a cube)
c = tf.random.uniform(shape=(2,3,4))  

# 4D random tensor (like a cube with multiple layers)
d = tf.random.uniform(shape=(2,3,4,5))  


âœ… Summary in simple terms:
============================

A random tensor = a "box" filled with random numbers.

You decide the size of the box (shape), the rule for picking numbers (distribution), and the range of numbers.

Randomness is essential for ML to work properly (e.g., training neural networks).
