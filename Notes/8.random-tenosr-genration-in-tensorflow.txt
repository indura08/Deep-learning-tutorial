🔹 What is a Random Tensor?
==============================

A tensor (like we discussed) is just a container for numbers, shaped in some way (1D, 2D, 3D, etc.).

A random tensor means:

Instead of filling it with fixed numbers (like [1,2,3]),

TensorFlow fills it with randomly chosen numbers.

These numbers are not predictable but follow certain rules (like rolling dice, flipping coins, or picking numbers from a box).

🔹 Why Generate Random Tensors?
==================================

In machine learning, randomness is super important:

1. Weights initialization – When training neural networks, the starting values of weights are random.

2. Data shuffling – Keeps training unbiased.

3. Simulation – You can test models with random input data.

🔹 Ways to Generate Random Tensors in TensorFlow
==================================================

1. Uniform distribution – numbers are picked with equal chance from a range.

import tensorflow as tf

# Random numbers between 0 and 1
x = tf.random.uniform(shape=(3,3), minval=0, maxval=10)  
print(x)


👉 Each number is equally likely to be between 0 and 10.


2. Normal (Gaussian) distribution – numbers are chosen around a mean (average), like a bell curve.

y = tf.random.normal(shape=(3,3), mean=0, stddev=1)  
print(y)


👉 Most numbers will be close to 0, some a bit far away.


3. Random integers – whole numbers only.

z = tf.random.uniform(shape=(3,3), minval=1, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)
print(z)


👉 Gives you random integers from 1 to 9.


🔹 Key Things to Understand
=============================

shape → tells the "box size" of numbers you want (e.g., (3,3) is a 3×3 grid).

distribution type → tells how the numbers are picked (uniform, normal, etc.).

range → minimum and maximum values.

🔹 Example with Different Shapes
===================================

# 1D random tensor (like a line of numbers)
a = tf.random.uniform(shape=(5,))  

# 2D random tensor (like a table)
b = tf.random.uniform(shape=(3,3))  

# 3D random tensor (like a cube)
c = tf.random.uniform(shape=(2,3,4))  

# 4D random tensor (like a cube with multiple layers)
d = tf.random.uniform(shape=(2,3,4,5))  


✅ Summary in simple terms:
============================

A random tensor = a "box" filled with random numbers.

You decide the size of the box (shape), the rule for picking numbers (distribution), and the range of numbers.

Randomness is essential for ML to work properly (e.g., training neural networks).

🔹 The Problem with Randomness
================================

When we say "random", we expect different numbers every time.

But in programming, we often need reproducible randomness.
👉 Example: You’re training a neural network today and tomorrow — you want the random starting weights to be the same, so results can be compared.

That’s where seeds and Generators come in.

🔹 What is a Seed?
=====================

A seed is like the "starting point" of randomness.

Imagine you shuffle a deck of cards.

If I tell you “start shuffling in this exact way,” and you do the same steps again, you’ll get the same shuffle every time.

That’s what a seed does: it makes "randomness" predictable and repeatable.


So:

tf.random.set_seed(7)


or

tf.random.Generator.from_seed(7)


👉 means: “start random number generation from this fixed starting point.”


🔹 What is Generator?
=======================

The Generator is TensorFlow’s random number machine.

Think of it like a "random number factory."

from_seed(7) means: build a factory that will always start producing numbers in the same pattern if you give it the same seed.


🔹 Now Let’s Look at Your Code

random_1 = tf.random.Generator.from_seed(7)
random_1 = random_1.normal(shape=(3,2))

random_2 = tf.random.Generator.from_seed(7)
random_2 = random_2.normal(shape=(3,2))

random_1, random_2, random_1 == random_2



Step by step:

1. tf.random.Generator.from_seed(7)
→ Creates a "random factory" with seed 7.

2. .normal(shape=(3,2))
→ Ask the factory for random numbers from a normal distribution (bell curve) in shape (3 rows, 2 columns).

Example output (not exact, but structure like this):

[[-0.43,  1.12],
 [ 0.56, -0.32],
 [ 0.10,  0.87]]


3. Do the same thing again with random_2.
Since both factories were started with the same seed (7), they’ll generate the same numbers.

4. random_1 == random_2
→ Checks element by element if they’re equal.
Since both are identical, you’ll get:

[[True, True],
 [True, True],
 [True, True]]



✅ Key Takeaways
==================

Seed → makes randomness reproducible.

Generator → TensorFlow’s random number factory.

from_seed(7) → builds a factory that always produces the same "random" numbers when started fresh.

If you use the same seed, you get the same results → super useful in ML experiments (so you can debug and compare).


👉 Think of it like baking bread 🍞:

Seed = recipe instructions (fixed steps).

Generator = the oven.

Same recipe + same oven settings → same bread every time.
