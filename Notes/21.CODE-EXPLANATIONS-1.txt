I’m going to explain this like you’re looking inside the machine while it’s running.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is your code again for reference:

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(
    loss=tf.keras.losses.mae,
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(),
    metrics=["mae"]
)

model.fit(x, y, epochs=5)

Now let’s open it up piece by piece.

MODEL CREATION

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])



1. What is tf.keras?
=====================

TensorFlow (tf) has a high-level API called Keras.
Keras is the part that lets you build neural networks easily.

So:

tf.keras = neural network building tools


What is Sequential?

Sequential is a model type.

It means:

Layers are stacked in order.
Output of one layer becomes input of the next.

Think of it like a straight pipeline:

Input → Layer → Layer → Output

There is no branching.
No skipping.
Just one straight line.

Since you only have one layer here, the structure is:

Input → Dense(1) → Output

What is Dense?

Dense means:

Every input connects to every neuron in this layer.

It is a fully connected layer.

Mathematically, Dense does this:

output = (inputs × weights) + bias

That’s it.

In your case:

Dense(1)

means:

There is exactly one neuron in this layer.

So the model learns:

y = wX + b

This is linear regression.

What happens internally when the model is created?

At first:

Weights are randomly initialized.
Bias is randomly initialized.

Nothing is trained yet.

The model is just a structure with random numbers.
