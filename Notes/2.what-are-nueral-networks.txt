🔹 What is a Neural Network?
==============================

A neural network is a computer system that tries to work a little like your brain.

Your brain has neurons (tiny cells) that pass signals to each other.

A neural network has artificial neurons (just math formulas) that pass numbers to each other.

It’s basically a system of layers of math that can learn patterns from data.

🔹 Structure of a Neural Network
==================================

Think of it as a layered sandwich 🥪:

1. Input layer → Data goes in.

Example: If you want to recognize cats, the input could be pixels of an image.

2. Hidden layers → Middle layers that do the “thinking.”

Each neuron takes numbers from the previous layer, does some math, and passes a result forward.

The deeper the network, the more it can figure out complex details (like whiskers, eyes, ears).

3. Output layer → Final answer comes out.

Example: “This is a cat” or “This is a dog.”

🔹 How neurons work (in simple terms)
=======================================

Each neuron:

Takes some inputs (numbers).

Multiplies them by weights (like importance scores).

Adds them up.

Passes the result through an activation function (decides if the neuron “fires” or not).

Sends the result to the next layer.

👉 In short: Input → Weighted math → Decision → Output.


🔹 Learning in a neural network
==================================

At first, the network guesses randomly.

If it’s wrong, it adjusts the weights (importance of inputs).

This adjustment is called training.

Over thousands of tries, it gets better at recognizing patterns.

Example:

Input: 🐱 picture

Output: The network says “dog” ❌

The system corrects itself → next time, it’s a bit closer to saying “cat.” ✅


🔹 Real-world examples
========================

Netflix recommending shows 🎬 (neural networks spot what you like).

Google Photos grouping “all your beach pictures” 🌊.

Self-driving cars 🚗 recognizing traffic lights.

👉 In one simple sentence:
A neural network is a system of layers of artificial neurons that pass numbers around, do math, and adjust themselves to learn patterns from data — kind of like a brain made of math.
