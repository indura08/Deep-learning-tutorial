We are talking about regression.

Regression means:
Predicting a number.

Now you asked:
What are regression inputs and outputs?

Let’s define them clearly.

1. What are inputs in regression?

Inputs are the information you give the model.

They are also called:

features

independent variables

X

Inputs are things that help predict something.

Example 1: House price prediction

Inputs could be:

Size of house (1500 square feet)

Number of bedrooms (3)

Age of house (10 years)

These are inputs.

We give them to the model.

2. What is the output in regression?

The output is:
The number we want to predict.

Also called:

target

label

dependent variable

y

In house price example:

Output:

Price of house (250000)

That is one number.

Regression always predicts a number.

3. Simple math view

If we write it simply:

Input (X) → Model → Output (y)

Example:

X = [1500, 3, 10]
y = 250000

The model learns the relationship between X and y.

4. One input, one output example

Hours studied → Exam score

Input:
Hours studied = 5

Output:
Score = 82

So:

X = 5
y = 82

5. Multiple inputs, one output example

Input:
Height = 170
Weight = 70
Age = 25

Output:
Daily calorie need = 2200

So:

X = [170, 70, 25]
y = 2200

6. Shape in neural network regression

In TensorFlow, inputs are usually shaped like:

(number_of_samples, number_of_features)

Example:

100 houses
3 features per house

Input shape:
(100, 3)

Output shape:
(100, 1)

Because each house has one predicted price.

7. What the model actually learns

The model tries to learn:

A function that connects inputs to output.

Like:

y = f(X)

In simple linear regression:

y = wX + b

In neural network regression:

It uses multiple layers of:

multiply
add
apply activation
repeat

Finally producing one number.

8. Important things related to regression

Since you said explain everything related, here are the important connected ideas:

Continuous output
Regression outputs are continuous numbers.
Not categories.

Loss function
In regression, we measure error using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

That means:
Take prediction minus real value.
Square it.
Average it.

Example:

Real price = 250000
Predicted price = 240000

Error = 10000
Squared error = 10000^2

The model tries to reduce this error.

No probability classes
Unlike classification, regression does not output probabilities for classes.

9. Quick comparison

Regression:
Output = number
Example = temperature, salary, price

Classification:
Output = category
Example = cat or dog

10. Very simple summary

Inputs:
Numbers that describe the situation.

Output:
One number we want to predict.

Regression:
Learning the relationship between those inputs and that output number.
