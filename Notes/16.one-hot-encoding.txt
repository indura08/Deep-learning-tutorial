What is one-hot encoding?

One-hot encoding means:

Turning a category into a list of numbers where
only ONE position is 1
and all other positions are 0.

That’s it.

Step 1: Suppose we have 3 categories

Cat
Dog
Bird

We give them numbers:

Cat = 0
Dog = 1
Bird = 2

Step 2: Normal numeric labels

If we store them normally:

Cat → 0
Dog → 1
Bird → 2

But this is just a single number.

Step 3: One-hot version

Now instead of a single number, we create a list of length 3 (because we have 3 categories).

Cat (0) → [1, 0, 0]
Dog (1) → [0, 1, 0]
Bird (2) → [0, 0, 1]

Notice:

Length of list = number of categories

Only one value is 1

Rest are 0

Another example

We have 4 categories:

Red
Blue
Green
Yellow

We number them:

Red = 0
Blue = 1
Green = 2
Yellow = 3

One-hot encoding:

Red → [1, 0, 0, 0]
Blue → [0, 1, 0, 0]
Green → [0, 0, 1, 0]
Yellow → [0, 0, 0, 1]

Length is 4 because there are 4 categories.

TensorFlow example

import tensorflow as tf

labels = tf.constant([0, 2, 1])

one_hot = tf.one_hot(labels, depth=3)

print(one_hot)

Output:

[[1. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1.]
 [0. 1. 0.]]

Depth means number of categories.

Important rule

If you have N categories,
each one-hot vector must have length N.

Very simple definition

One-hot encoding =
replace one number like 2
with a list like [0, 0, 1]

Only one position has 1.
Everything else is 0.
