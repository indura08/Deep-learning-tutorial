ðŸ”¹ What is a Tensor?

A tensor is just a fancy word for a container that holds numbers.

You can think of it as a generalization of arrays (like in NumPy).

It can have different dimensions (shapes) depending on the data.


ðŸ”¹ Breaking it down by dimensions

1. 0D Tensor (scalar) â†’ Just a single number
Example:

5


2. 1D Tensor (vector) â†’ A list of numbers
Example:

[1, 2, 3]


3. 2D Tensor (matrix) â†’ Rows and columns (like an Excel sheet)
Example:

[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6]]


4. 3D Tensor â†’ A stack of matrices
Example:

[
  [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]],
  [[7,8,9], [10,11,12]]
]


5. Higher-D tensors â†’ More dimensions (used for images, videos, etc.)

Images â†’ 4D tensor (batch, height, width, channels)

Videos â†’ 5D tensor (batch, frames, height, width, channels)

ðŸ‘‰ So a tensor is just numbers in multiple dimensions.


ðŸ”¹ Why tensors matter in TensorFlow
====================================

Tensors are the basic unit of data.

TensorFlow operations (like addition, multiplication, reshaping) all work on tensors.

Neural networks basically take tensors in â†’ do math â†’ output tensors.


ðŸ”¹ Analogy (super simple)
============================

Think of a tensor as a box that can hold numbers in different shapes:

0D = a dot âšª

1D = a line âž–

2D = a table ðŸ“Š

3D = a cube ðŸ§Š

Higher-D = cubes stacked into bigger cubes ðŸ”²

ðŸ‘‰ In one sentence:
======================

A tensor is just a container for numbers, like an array with multiple dimensions, and in TensorFlow itâ€™s the main way data is stored and processed.
