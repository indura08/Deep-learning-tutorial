🔹 First: Why do we need them?

Imagine you and 4 of your friends take a test (5 people total).

Everyone scores:

70, 71, 69, 70, 70

Another class scores:

40, 100, 20, 90, 50

👉 Both groups might have the same average (mean), but clearly, the spread of scores (how far the numbers are from the mean) is very different.

That spread is what variance and standard deviation measure.

🔹 Step 1: The Mean (Average)

The mean is just the average.
Formula:

Mean
=
Sum of all numbers
Count of numbers
Mean=
Count of numbers
Sum of all numbers
	​


Example:
Scores = [70, 71, 69, 70, 70]
Mean = (70 + 71 + 69 + 70 + 70) / 5 = 70

🔹 Step 2: Variance

Variance measures how spread out numbers are from the mean.
Formula:

Variance
=
∑
(
𝑥
𝑖
−
mean
)
2
𝑛
Variance=
n
∑(x
i
	​

−mean)
2
	​


👉 Steps:

Subtract mean from each number (find deviation).

Square it (so negatives don’t cancel).

Take the average of those squared deviations.

Example 1 (Low spread):
Scores = [70, 71, 69, 70, 70]
Mean = 70

Deviations from mean = [0, 1, -1, 0, 0]
Squares = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Average = (0+1+1+0+0)/5 = 0.4

Variance = 0.4 (very small → scores are very close together).

Example 2 (High spread):
Scores = [40, 100, 20, 90, 50]
Mean = 60

Deviations = [-20, 40, -40, 30, -10]
Squares = [400, 1600, 1600, 900, 100]
Average = (400+1600+1600+900+100)/5 = 920

Variance = 920 (huge → scores are very spread out).

🔹 Step 3: Standard Deviation (SD)

The standard deviation is just the square root of variance.
Why? Because variance is in squared units, and square root brings it back to the original scale.

Example 1: Variance = 0.4 → SD = √0.4 ≈ 0.63
Example 2: Variance = 920 → SD = √920 ≈ 30.3

👉 SD is easier to understand because it’s in the same units as the data.
(Exam scores = points, not points² 😅)

🔹 Intuition

Low variance / SD → numbers are packed tightly near the mean (stable, predictable).

High variance / SD → numbers are spread out (unstable, risky).

🔹 Real-life examples

Stock prices 📈

Stable stock → low SD (price doesn’t jump around much).

Risky stock → high SD (price fluctuates a lot).

ML models 🤖

In training, we use variance/SD to normalize data so all features are on a similar scale.

Example: Age (10–90) vs Salary (20,000–200,000). Without normalization, salary dominates.

✅ Summary:

Variance → average of squared distances from mean (spread-out measure).

Standard Deviation → square root of variance (spread, but in same units as data).

Both tell us how consistent or spread out the data is.

Do you want me to also show you with Python code (TensorFlow or NumPy) so you can see variance and standard deviation in action on real data?
