🔹 First, What’s a Random Seed?
=================================

We already said:
A seed is like a recipe for randomness.

Same seed → same random numbers.

Different seed → different random numbers.

Now, TensorFlow gives us two ways to set seeds:
👉 global-level and operation-level.


🔹 Global-level Random Seed
===============================

This is like setting a default rule for randomness in your whole program.

Example:

tf.random.set_seed(42)  # Global seed


This means:
“From now on, all random operations will follow this rule so that results are reproducible.”

It’s like telling the kitchen:
“From now on, everyone should follow recipe #42 when making random bread 🍞.”

🔹 Operation-level Random Seed
================================

This is when you set a seed for one specific random operation only, not for everything.

Example:

a = tf.random.uniform(shape=(3,), seed=1)  # Operation-level seed
b = tf.random.uniform(shape=(3,), seed=1)  # Same op-level seed


Both a and b will produce the same random numbers, even if no global seed was set.

It’s like telling one chef in the kitchen:
“Hey, for this batch only, use recipe #1.”
